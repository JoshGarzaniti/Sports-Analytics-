## Load in packages
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggdark)
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(xgboost)
library(randomForest)
library(ggrepel)
library(nflreadr)
library(nflplotR)
library(nflfastR)
library(mice)
```

##Load in Data via NFLFastR
```{r}
pbp = nflfastR::load_pbp(2000:2024)
```
##Cleaning Steps
Ok now that we've loaded in our data, the first and most obvious thing we want to do is filter it down to only kicking play (field goal attempts and extra point attempts/PAT's)
```{r}
pbp = pbp%>%
  filter(play_type %in% c("extra_point", "field_goal"))

head(pbp, 10)
```

Since 2000, there have been 56,676 observations of plays in the nfl which either fit the description of a field goal or extra point attempt. Let's save this real quick so we don't have to load in all of the pbp data again.

##Save Kicking data subset.
```{r}
write.csv(pbp, "G:/My Drive/Personal Projects/NFL Kicking Analysis.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Alternatively, if you're just starting here, you can load in this data and skip the previous steps:

## Load in packages
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggdark)
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(xgboost)
library(randomForest)
library(ggrepel)
library(nflreadr)
library(nflplotR)
library(nflfastR)
library(mice)
```

#Load in saved csv
```{r}
pbp = read.csv("G:/My Drive/Personal Projects/NFL Kicking Analysis.csv")
```

Either way pbp should be the subset we are working off of. 

##Continue Data Cleaning and feature selection
Let's continue cleaning by scrubbing some of the existing features we know we probably won't use such as play id, game id etc...

```{r}
pbp = pbp%>%
  select(-game_id,

pbp
```

```{r}
##Mutate Game half into either 1 or 2 
pbp = pbp%>%
  mutate(game_half = ifelse(game_half == "Half1", 1, 2))

pbp
```


Create a unilateral "result" variable. Right now there are two vars (field goal result and xp result.) What I'm doing here is counting blocked and aborted values from both field goals and extra points as failed attempts or 0's, while successful trys are 1's. Alternatively if you wanted to just purely focus on made and missed kicks we could drop all values that are blocked from field_goal_result and all values that are aborted or blocked from extra_point_result before mutating to create a final result variable.

```{r}
pbp = pbp %>%
  mutate(
    result = case_when(
      field_goal_result == "made" ~ 1,
      field_goal_result %in% c("missed", "blocked") ~ 0,
      extra_point_result == "good" ~ 1,
      extra_point_result %in% c("failed", "blocked", "aborted") ~ 0))

pbp
```

Look at the variables we have remaining

```{r}
str(pbp)
```
We have 73 features left in our data. We can still clean this up because there's a fear vars that are either duplicates or we can proxy with others.I'm dropping the results because we now have the final mutated column. We don't need the play description or yard line (it's a combination of field side and actual yard line). Play type we can proxy through the field goal/xp flag columns; we don't need tackle/fumble variables either. The first stadium var in the data has too many NA's so we'll use the latter. Same with weather. and play clock since they're missing from 1999 and 2000 entirely. I also don't think home/ away coaching will help our analysis just because there might be too many factor levels with the amount of different coaches. 

```{r}
pbp = pbp%>%
  select(-yrdln, 
         -desc,
         -extra_point_result,
         -field_goal_result,
         -play_type,
         -tackle_with_assist_1_player_name,
         -tackle_with_assist_2_player_id,
         -tackle_with_assist_2_player_name,

         -stadium,
         -weather,

         -home_coach,
         -away_coach,
         -sp)

pbp
```

Now here's another big question.....do we keep all of the epa and wpa data in? 
I also want to look at the NA's we have remaining in our data

```{r}
str(pbp)

colSums(is.na(pbp))
```

##Dealing with NA's and Deciding if we want to keep epa/wpa data baked in
Going through these NA's, the first thing that is apparent to me is that all of the temperature and wind data is missing from indoor stadiums (this is an easy fix...we can look up what the average is across the league for indoor football stadiums for both or use mean's to impute). Drive, Yards Net and First Downs look like they're potentially off of turnovers (so the kicking team got the ball to start the possession off of a turnover and for some reason those vars weren't measures). We could either drop these vars or probably best impute them using MICE (the only other way would be to go back to the very original data set and fix the drive # in the original data). Kicker player name and ID we are going to at least need the name of those 31 kickers so I might look up those games manually and impute them myself.

Starting with the Kickers
```{r}
missing_kickers = pbp%>%
  filter(is.na(kicker_player_name ))

missing_kickers
```

Create a table of fixed Kicker Names
```{r}
fixed_names = data.frame(
  game_date = as.Date(c("2014-11-16", "2012-10-21", "2012-09-27", "2010-12-12", "2010-11-21
", "2010-10-31", "2009-10-18", "2009-09-27", "2008-12-28", "2008-11-16", "2008-10-26", "2008-09-21", "2007-12-16", "2007-12-09", "2007-11-25", "2007-09-09", "2007-02-04", "2006-12-24", "2006-12-10", "2006-12-11", "2005-12-24", "2005-12-18", "2004-12-19", "2004-11-21", "2003-12-07", "2003-09-21", "2002-12-15", "2002-11-24", "2002-11-11", "2002-10-20", "2002-09-15"
)),
  kicker_player_name = c("M.Crosby", "P.Dawson", "P.Dawson", "G.Gano", "G.Hartley", "K.Brown", "J.Scobee", "S.Graham", "D.Carpenter", "L.Tynes", "N.Rackers", "K.Brown", "J.Scobee", "J.Brown", "N.Kaeding", "L.Tynes", "A.Vinatieri", "S.Graham", "J.Nedney", "J.Wilkins", "J.Elam", "N.Rackers", "J.Hanson", "M.Stover", "T.Peterson", "A.Elling", "P.Dawson", "J.Tuthill", "S.Janikowski", "B.Cundiff", "H.Epstein")
)
```

Join that table with the pbp data to replace the missing kickers
```{r}
pbp = pbp%>%
  mutate(game_date = as.Date(game_date))%>%
  left_join(fixed_names, by = "game_date", suffix = c("", "_fix"))%>%
  mutate(
    kicker_player_name = if_else(is.na(kicker_player_name), kicker_player_name_fix, kicker_player_name))%>%
  select(-kicker_player_name_fix)

pbp

sum(is.na(pbp$kicker_player_name))
```

https://paisano-online.com/29258/sports/dome-field-advantage/


I'm mutating temperature for indoor stadiums to be ~70 degrees and effective wind speed to be 0 mph (since HVAC currents are incredible minimal). Note that there are some stadiums that fluctuate from 70-72 degrees and the vikings are apparently know to start colder in the season (high 80's), but for this analysis let's just use a league constant of 70.
```{r}
pbp = pbp%>%
  mutate(temp = ifelse(is.na(temp), 70, temp))%>%
  mutate(wind = ifelse(is.na(wind), 0, wind))
```

#Now to fix drive, ydsnet and drive_first_downs

I'm using the MICE package here to impute values for each of these variables. What MICE does is that it creates multiple imputations for each missing value via Gibbs sampling, guesses the value based on all of the other variables in the data, and goes through x iterations of said process until it finds a good enough synthetic value to replace that missing one with. 

Now MICE historically handles categorical and numerical data well so I want to look through the structure of our data to make sure we are good to use this function.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-language/mice-package-in-r/

Let's start by updating some data types

```{r}
pbp = pbp%>%
  mutate(home_team = as.factor(home_team))%>%
  mutate(away_team = as.factor(away_team))%>%
  mutate(regular_season = ifelse(season_type == "REG", 1, 0))%>%
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week))%>%
  mutate(posteam = as.factor(posteam))%>%

  mutate(surface = as.factor(surface))%>%
  mutate(temp = as.numeric(temp))%>%
  mutate(wind = as.numeric(wind))%>%
  mutate(game_stadium = as.factor(game_stadium))
```

##Subsetting data to use MICE
variables we don't want in the subset:
game_date, game_stadium	Redundant with season- too many levels
kicker_player_name, kicker_player_id-	High cardinality, not predictive of drive
penalty, extra_point_attempt, field_goal_attempt-	These often occur after or during a scoring play, may introduce leakage into drive outcome
result-	Not helpful unless you're imputing game-level outcomes
series, yardline_100, posteam, defteam-	May introduce bias or data leakage if you're imputing drive (since drive relates to field position and team)

Let's use the rest

```{r}
pbp_mice = pbp%>%
  select(
    drive, drive_first_downs, ydsnet,
    quarter_seconds_remaining, half_seconds_remaining, game_seconds_remaining,
    game_half, qtr, goal_to_go, ydstogo,

pbp_complete[, c("drive", "ydsnet", "drive_first_downs")] = 
  pbp_imputed[, c("drive", "ydsnet", "drive_first_downs")]

```

Let's save our work so far

```{r}
write.csv(pbp_complete, "G:/My Drive/Personal Projects/pbp_complete.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

#Load in saved csv

```{r}
pbp_complete = read.csv("G:/My Drive/Personal Projects/pbp_complete.csv")
```


#Consolidating Up Surface Types
I'm noticing a few things with the different types of surfaces here. We can probably combine "a_turf" and "astroturf" alongside the two main grasses under two common astroturf and grass values. Let's also label the blank one as unknown. 

```{r}
pbp_complete = pbp_complete%>%
  mutate(surface = ifelse(surface %in% c("a_turf", "astroturf"), "astroturf", surface))%>%
  mutate(surface = ifelse(str_detect(surface, "^\\s*grass\\s*$"), "grass", surface))%>%
  mutate(surface = ifelse(str_detect(surface, "^\\s*$"), "Unknown", surface))

table(pbp_complete$surface)
```
A brief explanation of surface types remaining:

Astroplay – Synthetic turf brand, like FieldTurf, rubber infill.

Astroturf – Original brand name of synthetic turf.

FieldTurf – Popular modern synthetic turf with rubber/sand infill.

MatrixTurf – Synthetic turf (used in AT&T Stadium).

SportTurf – Another brand of synthetic turf.

We could probably file these all under "Turf"/Synthetic grass

Grass – This should include all standard natural grass.

Dessograss – This is actually a hybrid surface (natural grass reinforced with synthetic fibers), similar to the surface used in some European soccer stadiums. Behaves more like grass than turf.

These two we could probably group under "natural"

Let's just quickly make a feature to bin those two groups

```{r}
pbp_complete = pbp_complete%>%
  mutate(surface_type = ifelse(str_detect(surface,"^\\s*(astroplay|astroturf|fieldturf|matrixturf|sportturf)\\s*$"), "Artificial", "Natural"))%>%
  mutate(surface_type = ifelse(surface == "Unknown", "Unknown", surface_type))

#again quickly run a table here to make sure we didn't mis-capture any types

table(pbp_complete$surface_type)
```



Now we don't have to deal with missing data anymore. The next step is creating target variables. We already created on called "result" which in essence was just a make or miss variable based on if a kicker made their try attempt, but now let's make a derived variable based off of that value called probability, which is the probability of that kicker making that attempt.

P(x) we can determine a few ways:

we can group all of the attempts by distance, distance and weather, distance, weather turf condition, distance, weather, turf condition, temperature, and wind......or all of those and throw in the stadium. In that sense what we are doing is taking a historical average of how many attempts from that spot on that field in those conditions were made vs missed.....the thing we have to be smart about is not narrowing our sample size down too much to where we condense the number of tries going into the historical average. E.g say a there's only been one attempt at Lambeau field from 65 yards out, and miraculously the kicker made it.....on the next attempt from that location a kicker would be going up against a p(x) of 100% (which in theory says they should make that kick 100% of the time), yet we all know that's not factual in reality.

if we group up by:
distance
roof type
temperature
wind speed
and surface type
let's see what the empirical results of each attempt are:

```{r}
pbp_complete_grouped = pbp_complete%>%
  group_by(kick_distance, roof, temp, wind, surface)%>%
  mutate(probability_advanced = mean(result, na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  ungroup()

pbp_complete_grouped
```

A good baseline for this is to just check by distances (our probability should be dropping of drastically by distance so let's see what that distribution looks like)

```{r}
distance_vs_probability_plot = ggplot(pbp_complete_grouped, 
                                      mapping = aes(x = kick_distance,
                                                    y = probability_advanced))+
                                      geom_point()+
                                      geom_smooth()+
                                      dark_theme_minimal()+
                                      labs(title = "NFL Kick Distance vs Make Probability (advanced)", subtitle = "from 1999-2024", x = "Distance", y = "Probability")

distance_vs_probability_plot
```
What about binning vars like temp and wind?

```{r}
pbp_complete_binned = pbp_complete%>%
  mutate(
    temp_bin = cut(temp, breaks = c(-Inf, 30, 50, 70, 90, Inf), labels = c("cold", "chilly", "mild", "warm", "hot")),
    wind_bin = cut(wind, breaks = c(-Inf, 5, 10, 20, Inf), labels = c("calm", "breezy", "windy", "gusty")))%>%
  group_by(kick_distance, roof, temp_bin, wind_bin, surface)%>%
  mutate(
    group_n = n(),
    probability_advanced = ifelse(group_n >= 5, mean(result, na.rm = TRUE), NA_real_))%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  mutate(
    probability_advanced = ifelse(is.na(probability_advanced), mean(result, na.rm = TRUE), probability_advanced))
```

Visualizing this

```{r}
distance_vs_probability_plot_2 = ggplot(pbp_complete_binned, 
  aes(x = kick_distance, y = probability_advanced)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = group_n), alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_hline(
    yintercept = mean(pbp_complete$result, na.rm = TRUE), 
    linetype = "dashed", 
    color = "red", 
    alpha = 0.6)+
  dark_theme_minimal()+
  labs(
    title = "NFL Kick Distance vs Make Probability (advanced)", 
    subtitle = "from 1999-2024", 
    x = "Distance", 
    y = "Probability")

distance_vs_probability_plot_2
```

Facet Wrap by Roof type

```{r}
distance_vs_probability_roof = ggplot(pbp_complete_binned, 
  aes(x = kick_distance, y = probability_advanced))+
  geom_point(aes(size = group_n), alpha = 0.6)+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
  geom_hline(
    yintercept = mean(pbp_complete$result, na.rm = TRUE), 
    linetype = "dashed", color = "red", alpha = 0.6)+
  facet_wrap(~ roof)+
  dark_theme_minimal()+
  labs(
    title = "NFL Kick Distance vs Make Probability by Roof Type",
    subtitle = "From 1999–2024",
    x = "Distance",
    y = "Make Probability")

distance_vs_probability_roof
```

What about Surface type is there a relationship between distance and surface type when it comes to the probability of making kicks?

```{r}
distance_vs_probability_surface = ggplot(pbp_complete_binned, 
  aes(x = kick_distance, y = probability_advanced))+
  geom_point(aes(size = group_n), alpha = 0.6)+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_hline(
    yintercept = mean(pbp_complete$result, na.rm = TRUE), 
    linetype = "dashed", color = "red", alpha = 0.6)+
  facet_wrap(~ surface) +
  dark_theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "NFL Kick Distance vs Make Probability by Field Surface",
    subtitle = "From 1999–2024",
    x = "Distance",
    y = "Make Probability")

distance_vs_probability_surface
```

#Early Analytical Questions

Here are some of the early questions I'm thinking about at this stage:

- in terms of general trends we can see that kicking accuracy has a negative relationship with distance (this makes sense and is our first check)

-kicking accuracy has strong(ger) negative relationships with distance in: closed, dome, and outdoor stadiums, but more of a logarithmic relationship with distance in open stadiums (research this)

-kicking accuracy on astroplay, astroturf, matrixturf, and sportturf surfaces appears to not have as drastic negative consequences over longer distances as field turf and grass (research what stadiums carry these types and if they're indoors or an even mix of different stadium types)

-dessograss and unknown surface types have almost a completely stable/level relationship with distance (this doesn't appear to be natural or make sense so more research is needed)
