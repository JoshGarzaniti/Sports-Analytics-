Please use both of the RMD's. 
You will need to download and use the .txt 2011 PGA championship data file to start the RMD and just use your local file path to import that in. 
Other csv's reflect dataframes that were output results with writing them as a part of saving the code later, but just the .xtx should be necessary. 
The Shotlink analysis RMD was the initial file where I used a heatmap overlay against the image of the golfhole itself to attempt to visualize strokes remaining.
The density graphs RMD reflects how I was able to later visualize shots remaining and shots gained/lost in a more topographical sense. (This is the better file to use and my final output).
